# Building

### yarn install

Installs all the dependencies you need to make the other commands run, and to build your project.

### yarn clean

Deletes the build artefacts under `./lib` and `./dist`

### yarn format

Format the code to make it consistent with the formatting rules.

### yarn lint

Lints the code to make it consistent with the linting rules.

### yarn compile

Compiles the Typescript `./src` files into their corresponding Javascript files in `./lib`.

### yarn build

Compiles the Typescript `./src` files into a single Javascript releasable file in `./dist`.

### yarn test

Tests the code.

### yarn package

Does all of the above, building the project only once it's been formatted, linted, and tested.
